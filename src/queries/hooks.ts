/**
 * React Query hooks. These own all async data access and caching.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *  - The daily artifact is fetched ONCE (keyed by thread/date) and cached raw,
 *    so re-merging when the bug list arrives doesn't re-download it.
 *  - The Bugzilla bug list is its own query. A failure is a real error state
 *    (retried, not cached) — we must never cache an empty bug list as success,
 *    or a transient Bugzilla blip silently disables bug-merging for the whole
 *    session.
 *  - Processing (worker) is gated only on the profile, NOT on bugs: the list
 *    renders immediately (unmerged) and re-merges once bugs load. Including the
 *    bug list's update time in the processing key drives that re-merge.
